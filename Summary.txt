The proposed algorithm involves using Yolo v7 for drone detection from IR images. Due to the imbalance data provided by the competition holders, where the number of images containing birds is much more than that containing drones, we perform data augmentation to improve the accuracy of the algorithm. The augmentation involves adding different types of distortion to the drone images, including salt and pepper noise, speckle noise, and uneven illumination noise. During testing, the algorithm achieved a precision of 94.2%, a recall of 94.2% and mean average precision (mAP) of 92.6% on the provided test data consisting of 726 drone images.

To track the detected drones, the SORT (Simple Online and Realtime Tracking) algorithm is utilized. Finally, to detect distortion in the drone images, a vision transformer and a customized CNN is employed.
